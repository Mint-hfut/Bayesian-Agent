Bayesian-Agent is a Bayesian self-evolving layer for turning agent failures into reusable, evidence-weighted Skills and SOPs across agent frameworks and execution harnesses.

It is designed to stand out from monolithic agent frameworks in three ways:

- **Run from scratch**: start with no prior traces and evolve Skills during full benchmark or production runs.
- **Repair incrementally**: attach to an existing agent, read its failed trajectories, and rerun only the tasks that need repair.
- **Adapt across harnesses**: integrate with GenericAgent today, and with other agent frameworks through a portable trajectory schema and adapter boundary.

> v0.4 is the first standalone release. It includes the core Bayesian Skill Evolution package, schemas, CLI utilities, experiment artifacts, and a runnable GenericAgent adapter boundary. GenericAgent itself is not copied, vendored, or forked.

## 📅 News

- **2026-05-31:** Added the Bayesian Evidence Model as the default Skill belief backend, with a categorical likelihood implementation and a legacy Beta-Bernoulli backend for ablations.
- **2026-05-09:** Released Bayesian-Agent v0.4 as a standalone cross-harness Bayesian Skill Evolution package with schemas, CLI utilities, and experiment artifacts.
- **2026-05-09:** Added the optional GenericAgent adapter boundary without copying or vendoring GenericAgent.
- **2026-05-09:** Published bilingual project documentation and the Bayesian-Agent framework diagram.

## 🌟 Overview

Agent engineering is moving through three layers:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: write better task instructions.
2. **Context Engineering**: decide what evidence the model can see at inference time.
3. **Harness Engineering**: put the model inside an observable, executable, recoverable system.

Prompting can improve one answer. Context can improve one decision. Harness Engineering is what lets an agent work across tools, files, tests, memory, logs, and failure recovery.

In that setting, **Skills** and **SOPs** become first-class engineering assets. A good Skill is not just a longer prompt. It is compressed operational knowledge:

- what to inspect first
- which tools to use
- how to verify progress
- which failure modes to avoid
- when to stop, retry, or rewrite the procedure

Bayesian-Agent asks a simple question: if Skills are hypotheses about how to solve tasks, why should they evolve by anecdote instead of evidence? The answer is a framework-agnostic evolution layer that can bootstrap Skills from scratch, repair existing agents incrementally, and move across harnesses as long as they emit verified trajectories.

## 🧠 Core Idea

Most LLM engineering interventions fall into two MECE routes:

1. Change the model parameter distribution, such as pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.
2. Change the inference condition, such as prompts, context, RAG, tools, memory, and harnesses.

Bayesian-Agent focuses on the second route.

If a base model samples from:

```text
P(X | theta)
```

then an agent system samples from:

```text
P(X | theta, C)
```

where `C` is the inference environment. Skills, SOPs, tools, memory, retrieved evidence, execution traces, and verifier feedback are all part of `C`.

Bayesian-Agent treats each Skill or SOP as a hypothesis about success:

```text
P(success | theta, C, skill)
```

After each verified trajectory, the framework updates a posterior belief over that Skill. The posterior is used internally for Skill ranking, rewrite decisions, and failure-mode patches; model-facing benchmark prompts receive executable Skill/SOP text instead of raw probability summaries.

### What "Bayesian" Means in v0.5

Current Bayesian-Agent v0.5 defaults to a **Bayesian Evidence Model** for each Skill/SOP. The default implementation is a feature-conditioned categorical likelihood model: it estimates whether a Skill will succeed under observed evidence features such as task context, failure mode, token bucket, turn bucket, latency bucket, and selected metadata.

For a Skill hypothesis `h_k`, evidence `D_k = {(x_i, y_i)}` contains discrete features `x_i` and verified labels `y_i in {success, failure}`:

```text
P(y | h_k) = (N_y + alpha) / (N + alpha * |Y|)
P(x_j = v | y, h_k) = (N_{j,v,y} + alpha) / (N_{j,y} + alpha * |V_j|)
P(y = success | h_k, x) ∝ P(y = success | h_k) * Π_j P(x_j | y = success, h_k)
```

The implementation uses Laplace smoothing with `alpha = 1`. This is Bayesian in the posterior-belief sense: verified experience updates the probability of a Skill succeeding under a particular context and runtime signature. The default backend is exposed as `algorithm="categorical_bayes"`; `algorithm="naive_bayes"` remains accepted as a legacy alias for the same factorized categorical likelihood.

The current likelihood model uses **five fixed categorical evidence terms plus optional short metadata terms**:

| Evidence term | Why it is included |
|---|---|
| `context` | Captures task family, benchmark, or harness context. |
| `failure_mode` | Captures reusable error patterns that can become concrete Skill/SOP patches. |
| `token_bucket` | Captures whether a trajectory succeeded cheaply or only after expensive search. |
| `turn_bucket` | Captures recovery loops and interaction complexity. |
| `latency_bucket` | Captures slow tool, data, or API paths that may require different SOPs. |
| `metadata.*` | Adds harness-specific short scalar diagnostics without baking one harness schema into the core. |

`metadata.*` features are included only when the value is a short scalar (`str`, `int`, `float`, or `bool`, with string length at most 80). Runtime numbers are bucketed before entering the likelihood model so sparse exact values do not dominate early evidence.

For compatibility and ablation, the original **Beta-Bernoulli** posterior is still available via `algorithm="beta_bernoulli"` or `bayesian-agent evolve --algorithm beta_bernoulli`:

```text
p_k | D_k ~ Beta(alpha_0 + s_k, beta_0 + f_k)
E[p_k | D_k] = (alpha_0 + s_k) / (alpha_0 + beta_0 + s_k + f_k)
```

Both backends feed the same Skill ranking, posterior audit rendering, and rewrite actions such as `patch`, `split`, `compress`, `retire`, and `explore`. Full Bayesian model selection over competing Skill hypotheses is planned, but not claimed in v0.5.

## 📋 Core Features

- **Evidence-weighted Skill evolution**: update Skill beliefs from verified success and failure trajectories.
- **Bayesian Skill registry**: maintain Bayesian Evidence Model beliefs, optional Beta-Bernoulli posteriors, failure modes, token cost, latency, turns, and context distribution.
- **Failure-mode-aware repair**: identify recurring errors and generate focused repair plans.
- **Overfitting-resistant patch activation**: keep single failures as audit evidence, and promote a failure-mode patch into the benchmark prompt only after at least two verified occurrences.
- **Token-aware context building**: select concise, evidence-backed Skill/SOP text; benchmark prompts receive executable patches and guardrails, while posterior numbers stay in artifacts.
- **Full self-evolution from scratch**: run all tasks, collect evidence online, and evolve Skills without prior traces.
- **Incremental repair for existing agents**: consume failed trajectories from a baseline agent and rerun only the failed tasks.
- **Cross-harness adaptation**: integrate with GenericAgent today and other agent frameworks through adapters instead of vendoring their code.
- **Standard-library-first core**: v0.4 has no runtime dependency beyond Python.

## 🧬 Self-Evolution Mechanism

```text
[Agent Trajectory]
      |
      v
[Verifier / Benchmark Grader]
      |
      v
[TrajectoryEvidence: success, failure mode, tokens, turns, latency]
      |
      v
[Bayesian Skill Registry: posterior + cost + contexts]
      |
      v

      |
      v
[Executable Skill Patches / Guardrails]
      |
      v
[Next Agent Run]
```

For each Skill or benchmark SOP, Bayesian-Agent maintains:

- a Bayesian Evidence Model over success and failure conditioned on evidence features
- an optional Beta-Bernoulli posterior over global success probability
- verified success and failure evidence
- failure mode counts
- input, output, and total token statistics
- latency and turn statistics
- context distribution
- rewrite policy recommendations

The default rewrite policy is intentionally small and matches the current implementation:

| Policy action | Current trigger | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `explore` | no observations, or posterior remains uncertain | Avoids rewriting before verified evidence exists. |
| `retire` | `beta >= 4` and `success_probability < 0.45` | Avoids retiring after one or two unlucky failures, but removes clearly harmful Skills. |
| `patch` | one `failure_mode` appears at least twice | Treats repeated failures as actionable evidence while avoiding one-off overfitting. |
| `split` | at least 3 contexts and at least 4 observations | Prevents one broad SOP from covering incompatible task contexts. |
| `compress` | at least 3 observations and `success_probability >= 0.72` | Distills stable Skills to reduce token cost after enough positive evidence. |

These thresholds are conservative v0.5 heuristics, not claims of optimality. The design goal is an inspectable posterior-driven policy that can be swapped out by downstream harnesses.

## 🚀 Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataArcTech/Bayesian-Agent.git
cd Bayesian-Agent
python -m pip install -e .
```

The package currently requires Python 3.9+ and has no runtime dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Update a Bayesian Skill registry from existing agent results:

```bash
bayesian-agent evolve \
  --results artifacts/ga_deepseek_baseline/sop_results.json \
  --registry temp/bayesian_skill_beliefs.json \
  --context-out temp/skill_context.md
```

Find failed tasks for incremental repair:

```bash
bayesian-agent repair-plan \
  --baseline artifacts/ga_deepseek_baseline/sop_results.json \
  --out temp/failed_tasks.json
```

Summarize a run:

```bash
bayesian-agent summarize \
  --results artifacts/bayesian_incremental/results.json \
  --out temp/summary.json
```

Run a live GenericAgent-backed benchmark experiment. Use the same script for SOP-Bench, Lifelong AgentBench, and RealFin-Bench; switch benchmarks with `--bench core`, `--bench sop`, `--bench lifelong`, or `--bench realfin`. Use `--model` to switch between `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`:

```bash
cd Bayesian-Agent
export GENERICAGENT_ROOT="/path/to/GenericAgent"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-..."
export MODEL="deepseek-v4-flash"
"$GENERICAGENT_ROOT/.venv/bin/python" \
  experiments/run_benchmarks.py \
  --genericagent-root "$GENERICAGENT_ROOT" \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --mode all \
  --bench core
```

With `--bench core`, the runner fans out into separate benchmark roots instead of sharing one combined directory: `results/sop_${MODEL//-/_}` and `results/lifelong_${MODEL//-/_}`. If you pass `--out-root temp/core_${MODEL//-/_}`, it is treated as a parent directory and the runs go to `temp/core_${MODEL//-/_}/sop` and `temp/core_${MODEL//-/_}/lifelong`.

Use `--limit 1` for a smoke test before running the full benchmark. For RealFin-Bench, keep the same command shape and set `--bench realfin`; the default root becomes `results/realfin_${MODEL//-/_}`.

Run incremental repair against an existing GA baseline by passing its result files. The script reruns only failed tasks:

```bash
"$GENERICAGENT_ROOT/.venv/bin/python" \
  experiments/run_benchmarks.py \
  --genericagent-root "$GENERICAGENT_ROOT" \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --mode bayesian-incremental \
  --bench core \
  --baseline-results artifacts/ga_deepseek_baseline/sop_results.json \
  --baseline-results artifacts/ga_deepseek_baseline/lifelong_results.json
```

## 🐍 Python API

```python
from bayesian_agent import BayesianSkillRegistry, SkillContextBuilder, TrajectoryEvidence

registry = BayesianSkillRegistry("temp/beliefs.json")
registry.record(
    TrajectoryEvidence(
        task_id="sop_12",
        skill_id="benchmark/sop_bench",
        context="sop_bench",
        outcome="failure",
        failure_mode="xml_wrapped_answer",
        input_tokens=70123,
        output_tokens=4242,
        total_tokens=74365,
    )
)

skill_context = SkillContextBuilder(registry).render(task_context="sop_bench")
print(skill_context)
```

`SkillContextBuilder` renders a compact posterior audit view. The built-in SOP/Lifelong runners convert recurring posterior-backed failure modes into executable patches and guardrails before adding them to model prompts.

## 🔁 Three Operating Patterns

### 🌱 Full Self-Evolving Mode

Bayesian-Agent starts from scratch, runs benchmark tasks, collects verified evidence, and evolves Skills during the run.

This mode tests whether Bayesian Skill Evolution can improve an agent without relying on prior traces.

### 🛠️ Incremental Repair Mode

Bayesian-Agent can also attach to an existing agent. The base agent runs first. Bayesian-Agent reads its success and failure traces, updates posterior Skill beliefs, then reruns only the failed tasks.

```text
Base Agent -> Failure Traces -> Bayesian Skill Evolution -> Rerun Failures -> Higher Accuracy
```

This is the recommended production path because it improves an existing agent without retraining the model or replacing the original harness.

### 🔌 Cross-Harness Adaptation Mode

Bayesian-Agent is not tied to a single agent runtime. Any agent framework can become a backend if it emits the common trajectory schema and accepts model-facing Skill/SOP text through an adapter.

```text
Any Agent Harness -> Trajectory Schema -> Bayesian Skill Registry -> Adapter -> Next Harness Run
```

This makes Bayesian-Agent a portable Skill/SOP evolution layer rather than another closed agent framework.

## 📊 Experimental Results

The v0.4 prototype was validated with GenericAgent and `deepseek-v4-flash` on SOP-Bench and Lifelong AgentBench.

### 🧱 Baseline: GenericAgent + deepseek-v4-flash

| Benchmark | Agent | Model | Accuracy | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Tokens | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SOP-Bench | GA | deepseek-v4-flash | 80% | 1.34M | 57k | 1.39M | 11.47 |
| Lifelong AgentBench | GA | deepseek-v4-flash | 90% | 649k | 42k | 690k | 26.07 |

### 🌱 Full Self-Evolving Run

| Benchmark | Agent | Model | Accuracy | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Total Tokens | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SOP-Bench | GA+Bayesian | deepseek-v4-flash | 100% | 1.07M | 52k | 1.12M | 17.86 |
| Lifelong AgentBench | GA+Bayesian | deepseek-v4-flash | 95% | 666k | 44k | 710k | 26.77 |

In full mode, Bayesian-Agent improved SOP-Bench from 80% to 100% while reducing token usage from 1.39M to 1.12M. Lifelong AgentBench improved from 90% to 95% with similar token cost.

### 🛠️ Incremental Repair Run

In incremental mode, Bayesian-Agent only reran failed GenericAgent tasks:

- SOP-Bench: 4 failed tasks, all repaired
- Lifelong AgentBench: 2 failed tasks, all repaired

| Benchmark | Agent | Model | Final Accuracy | Incremental Input | Incremental Output | Incremental Total | Incremental Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| SOP-Bench | GA+BayesianIncremental | deepseek-v4-flash | 100% | 254k | 14k | 268k | 14.93 |
| Lifelong AgentBench | GA+BayesianIncremental | deepseek-v4-flash | 100% | 129k | 10k | 139k | 14.41 |

The result shows that Bayesian-Agent can work as a plug-in repair layer: it can take an existing agent below 100% accuracy and improve it with a small amount of incremental inference. This is the practical advantage over one-off benchmark agents: Bayesian-Agent can sit beside a harness, learn from its failures, and improve it without replacing it.

Experiment artifacts are stored under [`artifacts/`](artifacts/), and the method note is in [`docs/method.md`](docs/method.md).

To reproduce the same experiment shape with another model, change only `--model`:

```bash
export MODEL="deepseek-v4-pro"
"$GENERICAGENT_ROOT/.venv/bin/python" \
  experiments/run_benchmarks.py \
  --genericagent-root "$GENERICAGENT_ROOT" \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --mode all \
  --bench core
```

The script runs three phases by default: GA baseline, Bayesian full self-evolution, and Bayesian incremental repair using the fresh baseline for the selected model. Each selected benchmark writes its own `summary.md` under its benchmark-specific result root.

## 🔌 GenericAgent and Cross-Harness Adaptation

The first prototype was validated inside GenericAgent, but Bayesian-Agent is not a GenericAgent fork and not just a GenericAgent add-on.

The open-source structure is:

- `bayesian_agent/core/`: framework-agnostic Bayesian Skill Evolution logic
- `bayesian_agent/adapters/base.py`: minimal adapter contract for external agents
- `bayesian_agent/adapters/generic_agent.py`: optional GenericAgent boundary
- `schemas/`: portable trajectory and Skill belief schemas
- `artifacts/`: reproducible benchmark result files

GenericAgent remains the current experimental backend. Users can integrate Bayesian-Agent with their own agent harness by emitting the common trajectory schema and implementing the adapter boundary.

The long-term direction is to make Bayesian-Agent the Bayesian Skill/SOP evolution layer for many agent runtimes: GenericAgent, our own upcoming Agent harness, and other external frameworks.

MinimalAgent adapter support is intentionally not included in v0.4.
