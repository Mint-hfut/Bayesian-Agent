# Adapters

Bayesian-Agent is designed to integrate with external agent harnesses without copying their code. This is one of the main reasons the project is not just another agent framework: the Bayesian layer can improve whichever harness emits verified trajectories.

## Adaptation Advantage

Bayesian-Agent separates Skill evolution from task execution:

```text
Harness executes -> Bayesian-Agent learns -> Adapter injects model-facing Skill/SOP text -> Harness reruns
```

That separation enables three deployment styles:

- run a full benchmark from scratch with Bayesian Skill evolution enabled
- repair only the failed tasks from an existing agent run
- reuse the same Skill belief registry across compatible harnesses

## Adapter Contract

An external harness should satisfy the `AgentAdapter` protocol:

```python
from typing import Any, Mapping, Protocol

class AgentAdapter(Protocol):
    def run(self, task: Mapping[str, Any], skill_context: str) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
        ...
```

The adapter receives:

- a task object from the external benchmark or application
- model-facing Skill/SOP text selected or patched by Bayesian-Agent

It returns:

- a trajectory-like mapping that can be converted into `TrajectoryEvidence`

## GenericAgent Adapter

The GenericAgent adapter is intentionally thin: it runs one prompt in one workspace. Benchmark loops and Bayesian Skill evolution stay in Bayesian-Agent.

```python
from bayesian_agent.adapters.generic_agent import GenericAgentAdapter

adapter = GenericAgentAdapter(root="/path/to/GenericAgent", model="deepseek-v4-flash")
result = adapter.run(
    {
        "prompt": "Solve the task in this workspace.",
        "workspace": "temp/task_01",
        "max_turns": 8,
    },
    skill_context="### Bayesian Failure-Mode Patches\n...",
)
```

It does not eagerly import GenericAgent and does not vendor GenericAgent source code. The experiment script `experiments/run_benchmarks.py` uses this adapter for task execution while Bayesian-Agent owns SOP-Bench, Lifelong AgentBench, and RealFin-Bench orchestration, evidence collection, posterior updates, and incremental repair.

## Why This Boundary Matters

Bayesian-Agent should be usable with more than one agent framework. The durable contract is the trajectory schema, not a copied harness implementation.

External systems should emit:

- task identity
- success or failure outcome
- failure mode
- token usage
- runtime metadata

Bayesian-Agent can then update beliefs, keep posterior audit artifacts, and render the next model-facing Skill/SOP text.

## Planned Bayesian-Agent Harness

Current experiments use GenericAgent as the backend harness. A dedicated Bayesian-Agent harness is planned so users can run the full loop without depending on GenericAgent, while still keeping GenericAgent and other frameworks as optional backends.

## MinimalAgent Status

MinimalAgent adapter support is intentionally not included in v0.4.

The recommended path is:

1. stabilize the GenericAgent boundary
2. keep the core trace schema portable
3. upload the dedicated Bayesian-Agent harness
4. add more adapters only after the adapter contract has enough real usage
