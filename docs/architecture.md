# Architecture

Bayesian-Agent is intentionally small. The framework core is independent from any specific agent harness, so the same Bayesian Skill/SOP evolution loop can support full runs, incremental repair, and cross-harness adaptation.

## Core Boundaries

`bayesian_agent.core` is framework-agnostic. It knows nothing about GenericAgent, benchmark runners, browser tools, or model APIs.

`bayesian_agent.adapters` defines how external harnesses can connect. The GenericAgent adapter in v0.4 is intentionally a boundary placeholder, not a vendored copy of GenericAgent.

This separation is what prevents Bayesian-Agent from being swallowed by the agent framework category. It is a reusable Bayesian evolution layer that can sit beside multiple harnesses rather than competing with all of them as another monolithic runtime.

`schemas/` defines portable JSON shapes for trajectories and Skill beliefs.

`artifacts/` contains result files from the initial GenericAgent validation. GenericAgent is the current experimental harness; a dedicated Bayesian-Agent harness is planned.

## Persistence Model

`BayesianSkillRegistry` persists beliefs as JSON:

```python
registry = BayesianSkillRegistry("temp/beliefs.json", algorithm="naive_bayes")
registry.record(event)
registry.save()
```

The registry can also run in memory:

```python
registry = BayesianSkillRegistry.in_memory()
```

Use `algorithm="beta_bernoulli"` for the optional legacy global success-rate posterior.

## Context Rendering

`SkillContextBuilder` selects top posterior beliefs and renders concise context:

```python
context = SkillContextBuilder(registry).render(task_context="sop_bench", limit=5)
```

The rendered context tells the downstream agent to treat Skills as hypotheses rather than unquestioned instructions.
