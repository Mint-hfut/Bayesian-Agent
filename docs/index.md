Bayesian-Agent is a Bayesian self-evolving layer for turning verified agent trajectories into reusable, evidence-weighted Skills and SOPs across agent frameworks and execution harnesses.

The project focuses on the inference side of agent improvement. Instead of changing base model parameters, it changes the agent's inference environment by maintaining posterior beliefs over Skills, failure modes, token cost, and context-specific reliability.

In v0.x, the default Bayesian core is a per-Skill Naive Bayes posterior update over verified success/failure evidence and context/runtime features. The earlier Beta-Bernoulli update remains available as an optional compatibility backend. Fuller Bayesian model selection and uncertainty-aware Skill selection are planned in the roadmap.

Bayesian-Agent is designed to avoid being just another agent framework:

- **Full-run evolution from scratch**: run tasks without prior traces and evolve Skills online.
- **Incremental repair**: attach to an existing agent, learn from failed trajectories, and rerun only failed tasks.
- **Cross-harness adaptation**: integrate with GenericAgent today and other agent frameworks through a portable trajectory schema and adapter boundary.

## Why It Exists

LLM agent engineering has moved through three layers:

1. **Prompt Engineering**: make task instructions clearer.
2. **Context Engineering**: decide what evidence the model can see.
3. **Harness Engineering**: put the model inside a runnable, observable, recoverable system.

Skills and SOPs are the durable memory of a harness. Bayesian-Agent makes their evolution evidence-driven and portable:

Trajectory -> Verifier -> Evidence -> Posterior Skill Belief -> Better Context -> Next Run
```

## What v0.4 Includes

- Bayesian Skill registry with Naive Bayes context-conditioned updates and optional Beta-Bernoulli updates.
- Evidence schema for agent trajectories.
- Posterior-weighted Skill context rendering.
- Failure-mode-aware repair planning.
- CLI utilities for trace ingestion, summarization, and incremental repair.
- GenericAgent integration boundary without copying or vendoring GenericAgent.
- Three operating patterns: full self-evolution, incremental repair, and cross-harness adaptation.
- SOP-Bench and Lifelong AgentBench result artifacts.

## Next Steps

- Start with the [Quick Start](quick-start.md).
- Read the [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) if you want the Bayesian framing.
- Use the [CLI](cli.md) to update a registry from traces.
- Read [Adapters](adapters.md) to understand how Bayesian-Agent moves across harnesses.
- Inspect [Experiments](experiments/index.md) for the GenericAgent + `deepseek-v4-flash` validation.
