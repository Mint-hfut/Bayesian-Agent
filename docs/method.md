# Bayesian Self-Evolving Agent Method

Bayesian-Agent treats each Skill or SOP as a hypothesis about agent success under a task context. The method is harness-agnostic: it can bootstrap Skills in a full run, repair existing agents incrementally, or transfer the same posterior Skill registry across compatible harnesses.

```text
P(success | theta, C, h)
```

- `theta`: frozen base model parameters
- `C`: inference condition, including prompt, memory, tools, retrieved context, and harness feedback
- `h`: Skill/SOP hypothesis

The framework does not train the base model and does not require replacing the agent runtime. It changes the inference environment by maintaining posterior-weighted Skill context that can be injected through adapters.

## Bayesian Formulation in v0.x

The current default implementation uses a feature-conditioned Naive Bayes update for each Skill/SOP. It is Bayesian in the posterior-belief sense: verified trajectories update the probability that a Skill will succeed under an observed context and runtime signature. It is not yet a full Bayesian model-selection system over competing Skill hypotheses.

For Skill hypothesis `h_k`, let `D_k = {(x_i, y_i)}` be verified evidence. `y_i` is either `success` or `failure`, and `x_i` contains discrete evidence features such as context, failure mode, token bucket, turn bucket, latency bucket, and selected metadata:

```text
P(y | h_k) = (N_y + alpha) / (N + alpha * |Y|)
P(x_j = v | y, h_k) = (N_{j,v,y} + alpha) / (N_{j,y} + alpha * |V_j|)
P(y | h_k, x) ∝ P(y | h_k) * Π_j P(x_j | y, h_k)
```

Bayesian-Agent v0.x uses `alpha = 1` Laplace smoothing. The resulting `P(success | h_k, x)` is used for Skill ranking, context rendering, and rewrite policy decisions.

The original Beta-Bernoulli backend is still available for compatibility and ablation:

```text
p_k | D_k ~ Beta(alpha_0 + s_k, beta_0 + f_k)
E[p_k | D_k] = (alpha_0 + s_k) / (alpha_0 + beta_0 + s_k + f_k)
```

The general Bayesian model-selection form we plan to add later is:

```text
P(h_k | D) ∝ P(D | h_k) P(h_k)
```

That would let the framework compare multiple Skill hypotheses directly, rather than only tracking each Skill's success probability independently.

## Evidence

Each agent run emits `TrajectoryEvidence`:

- task id
- skill id
- context
- success or failure outcome
- token counts
- latency and turns
- failure mode
- task metadata

Evidence should be action-verified. For example, a benchmark grader, unit test, or deterministic checker should decide whether a run succeeded.

## Belief Update

Each Skill stores a selected belief backend:

```text
algorithm = naive_bayes        # default
algorithm = beta_bernoulli     # optional compatibility backend
```

For Naive Bayes, each verified event increments the class count and each extracted feature value count for the observed label. For Beta-Bernoulli, each verified success increments `alpha` and each verified failure increments `beta`.

The registry also tracks cost, context distribution, and failure modes. These statistics guide what gets injected into future context.

## Rewrite Policy

The default policy maps posterior state to actions:

- `compress`: repeated success suggests the Skill is stable
- `patch`: failures cluster around a recurring failure mode
- `split`: evidence spans different contexts
- `retire`: failures dominate the posterior
- `explore`: evidence is still sparse or uncertain

The policy is intentionally small in v0.4. It is designed to be replaced by project-specific policies.

For the built-in SOP-Bench and Lifelong AgentBench runners, `patch` is not only a label in the rendered context. Observed benchmark failure modes are mapped to concrete patch rules and injected into the next prompt under `Bayesian Failure-Mode Patches`. For example, `left_expected_output_blank` adds a CSV writeback verification rule, and `invented_unrequested_column` adds SQL column-use constraints. v0.x records post-patch evidence back to the same benchmark Skill; later releases may split recurring patches into separate child Skill hypotheses.

## Full Mode

Full self-evolving mode runs all tasks and updates Skill beliefs online. This mode tests whether Bayesian Skill Evolution can improve an agent from scratch.

## Incremental Repair Mode

Incremental repair mode starts from a baseline agent's traces:

```text
baseline traces -> failure ids -> Bayesian context -> rerun failures -> merged final result
```

This mode is the recommended production path because it adds Bayesian-Agent as a plug-in repair layer instead of replacing the base agent.
